## Overview
I decided to complete this challenge after completing Angela Yu's lesson on HTML and CSS Flexbox. Took me over 3 hours to get this done but I faced a bit of a challenge as I'm unable to make users not see the part of the summary section that doesn't have a curved border. I decided to rather make it's background the same as the body background so that users wont see any curved border for that part.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to successfully use Flexbox and media queries. I will keep on working on this project to make it perfect. This project aside from applying what I learned also taught me to be patient and find solutions to certain hurdles or obstacles i encounted. It took me over 3 hours to complete this.

### Continued development

I will be learning CSS Grid soon and I'll apply that to this project and see how it goes.
